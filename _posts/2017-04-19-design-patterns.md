title:  "Design Patterns"
---

After years developers wanted to write code that don't break or fail upon change or modify, code that easily modified and easily maintainable .

So design patterns was the solution for that, so what is design patterns ?

>in software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

#### Design patterns categories :

- Creational Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Behavioral Patterns

in the next post i will write more in details about the design patterns itself . and how to implement it .
